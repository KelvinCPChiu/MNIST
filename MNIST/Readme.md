The is the project working on MNIST

#Translation_Training.py is the main training program.

#Translation.py is used to check the generalization performance of different trained and saved models.

#Weight_Check.py is used to visualization of weight and computation of directed cross correlation in different layers (just particularly for LeNet-like).

#convolutional_mlp.py, logistic_sgd.py, mlp.py is the borrowed from theano tutorial library.
