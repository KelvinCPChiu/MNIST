# Projects coding with Theano
#Translation_Training_Updating.py is the main training program.
#Translation_Updating.py is used to check the generalization performance of different trained and saved models.
#Weight_Check.py is used to visualization of weight and computation of directed cross correlation in different layers (just particularly for LeNet-like).
#convolutional_mlp.py is the borrowed from theano tutorial library.
#fashion_mnist.py is the data loader testing code for Fashion MNIST Dataset.
